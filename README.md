 Software Engineers - Interview Assignment: Country Data Dashboard 
Software Engineers are found within many different teams, each with different responsibilities and focus areas â€“ such as infrastructure, manufacturing, support or web. Whilst the day-to-day of the role can vary, all Software Engineers need to manage different scenarios from stakeholders and be able to respond appropriately with their technical background and business insight. 
This assignment will put you in a situation that a Software Engineer may face within the infrastructure team. The scenario should be something you can relate to, but please keep in mind we are looking at the skills you will need to possess for a Software Engineer role in any of our teams, outlined in the assessment criteria. This is not an assessment of your infrastructure knowledge.
